Let's get ***SASSY!***


***BOOK RELEASE WEBSITE***

I wanted to see the difference between using Sass building a website vs Less.

This theme features a one page book release promotional site.

This website was created using ```BOOTSTRAP``` and ```SASS```, and is  ***COMPLETELY*** responsive!


This website I used
- navbar, 
- flexbox 
- the grid system, 
- card body
- form
- buttons
- subscription (form)
- accordion (card)
- & ```$variables``` (.scss)

-- With ```Sass``` i changed the ```primary variable color``` of bootstrap.

I used ```Koala GUI``` to compile ```Sass``` 


I used ```javascript``` to initiate ***scrollspy*** and ***smooth scrolling*** animation. 

-- I also used a ```javascript``` to display the current year when accessing the webpage.
